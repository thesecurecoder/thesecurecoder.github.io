# SOLID Principles
### Typical problems during project development and maintainence
* **Code Fragility**: Tendency of the software to break at many places everytime a change is made.
* **Code Rigidity**: Tendency of software to be difficult to change. A simple change in a place will require a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules.
* **Technical debt**: Cost of prioritizing fast delivery over code quality for long periods of time.

### SOLID principles
These principles help in keeping a check on the technical debt and health of a project:
* **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
* **O**pen Closed Principle
* **L**iskov Substitution Principle
* **I**nterface Segregation Principle
* **D**ependency Incersion Principle

These principles help in understanding changes better, make them faster and minimise the risk, make the code highly maintainable over longer periods of time and most importantly reduce the cost incurred due to technical debt. Other ways to maintain *clean code* are - constant refactoring, following design patterns and unit testing.
